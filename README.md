# Text2Scene
# Educational application to illustrate basic mathematical problems using Natural Language Processing

## Issue:
Students master basic operations :
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
But faced with a situation / problem , They are unable to visulize it.
## Solution:
Illustrating the situation / problem greatly facilitates its resolution.

### About this project 
This project was conducted as part of a summer internship at Esprit-INOBI.
The main idea is :
*  Using Stanza's (StanfordNLP) pretrained english and french models to analyze the input (from raw text to tokens+lemmas+POS tags)
*  Using Giphy API to represent each keyword with its illustration(stickers).
Text2scene also uses a number of other open source projects  which can be found in requirements.txt
### Limitation
The application is currently limited to entity based problems and geometric problems (no units of mesurements other than meters and its subdivisions).
**The app is currently being hosted on Heroku , you can check out the demo [Here] !**
